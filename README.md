##### Multi-Objective NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies, implemented with TypeScript.

This library implements a modified version of [NEAT](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf), along with a modified version of [NSGA-II](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017) to achieve Multi-Objective evolution of Neural Networks.

This project aims for performance and stability, and it's currently under development for study purposes.
